- The functions that were need for this problem were Tries Tree funtions so I centered them around the RouteTrie class
- I created _splitter() to handle spliting the input string in its needed format
- Both of RouteTrie.insert() and RouteTrie.find() follows a direct approach of starting from the root path, and slowly going down the path from there
- I used thi approach cause it is the fastest one possible to reach the required output
- The Time Complexity:
- - for RouteTrie.insert() it's O(n)
- - for RouteTrie.find() it's O(n)
- - for Router.add_handler() it's O(n)
- - for Router.lookup() it's O(n)
- The Space Complexity:
- - for RouteTrie.insert() it's O(1)
- - for RouteTrie.find() it's O(1)
- - for Router.add_handler() it's O(1)
- - for Router.lookup() it's O(1)
