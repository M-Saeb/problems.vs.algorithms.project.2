Design
- Because we are dealing with an unstorted array, there is no trick we can follow to cut the time complexity here
- The only thing we can do is to loop over all the elements while searching for both the smallest and biggest item in the array
- I started by setting the first item as both the biggest and smallest of the list, than loop over the other items and change accordingly
- I didn't use any algorithm for this problem cause I didn't need to
- The data structor I used is only the min & max variables and these are just inegers


Time Complexity
- Time complexity is O(n)


Space Complexity
- Space complexity is O(1)
