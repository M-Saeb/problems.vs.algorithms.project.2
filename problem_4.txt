Design
- I used the algorithm I learned in Leason 2, Chapter 15
- The idea is to put 0 and 2 in their correct positions, which will make sure all the 1s are automatically placed in their right positions
- The data structor I used are 2 points, one for 0's and one for 2's


Time Complexity
- Time complexity is O(n)


Space Complexity
- Space complexity is O(n)
