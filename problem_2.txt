Design
- Because we are searching a rotated array. This means we can search using the same methods for a sorted array by just taking negetive indexes into account

- EX: list a = [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
- - index 0 will give me the value of 4
- - index -1 will give the value of 3
- -  index 1 will give me the value of 5

- I just need to start at index = 0 and raise or lower the index to find the intended value

- EX: for the list a above
- - if was search for number 2
- - I'll start at index 0 which returns the value 4, because 4 > 2, I just need to lower the index to -1
- - now I have index -1 which returns the value 3, lower the index again
- - now I have index -2 which returns the value 2, which the saerched value
- - now I just need to convert the index to its posotive value (length of the list - the negetive index) (EX: 5 - 2) which will return 3

- I used this method cause I won't need to do any prepration for it before starting to search the array

- I didn't use a specific algorithms here cause I didn't need to

- As for the data structor, I only needed a integer variable for the index
