- Because we are searching a rotated array. This means we can search using the same methods for a sorted array by just taking negetive indexes into account
- I just need to start at index = 0 and raise or lower the index to find the intended value
- I used this method cause I won't need to do any prepration for it before starting to search the array
- As a result it gives a better time complexity than other methods
- Time Complexity is O(log(n))
- Space Complexity is O(1)
